                        <p>Had a great experience at Asha Multispeciality hospital. My father was hospitalised. When we came for checkup we barely had to wait & all the hospitalisation procedures were smooth.The staff and Doctor were all very friendly and helpful. I especially loved how Dr. Vijay Dongre & Dr. Chandrakant Shinde really took their time to explain my father’s conditions with me as well as his treatment options.I had a great visit and the doctor’s demeanor has really put me at ease so I recommend this hospital.</p>

                        <p> One of best Hospital Navi Mumbai.

                            
                            Doctors are genuine and friendly and mainly Dr.  Dongare is best doctor.
                            Hospital is clean.
                            Charges are minimal, I think know one providing this charges as compare service and hospitality.
                            Rooms are docent and clean as well as silence.
                            Nursing service also 5 star.
                            Doctors explain everything in detail no hidden information or charges.
                            Claim sattlement also fast and supportive.
                            Rooms are big.
                            No restrictions for guess.
                            Heater and shower available in washroom.
                            
                            
                            If you admit night at 9 o'clock then they consider it's emergency and they cost full day for room charge.
                            They don't have Citi scan and MRI facility.
                            
                            Suggestions
                            Calculate well when you return medicine to pharmacy in asha hospital.</p>

                        <p>The hospital service is not good  but the nurses and aunts were very talkative and took care .. I just want to notice two points here. After buying medicines frm medical no discount was applied also the medicine list was sent down without informing me. The doctor charged fees for the visit after operation to Remove stitches although it was included inthe package...</p>
